# Susbot5
newest version, now in socket flavour

# Requirements:
I use Windows 10, and Python 3.7.9 and the latest version of Google Chrome, if you have all 3 of thoses, there is a high chance you can run this bot.

# Installation:

 Download this entire folder that contains Susbot5
 
 Install specifically Python 3.7.9 
 
 During installation, enable the checkbox  "Add to PATH"
 
 After that, open your command prompt.
 
 Navigate to the folder with Susbot5. (in the command prompt)
 
 Type: pip install -r requirements.txt
 
 After it successfully installs that,
 
 if you plan to use reddit auto login,
 
 change your name/pass in crewmate.py
 
 Then you simply double click susbot.py
 
 If you don't want to use auto login,
 
 Then you should edit susbot.py
 
 and change the line that says
 
 reddit = "yes" to a "no"
 
 After that, save and run susbot.py
 
 You need to login manually each time you run the bot
 
 After you login manually, press F9 to connect the bot.
